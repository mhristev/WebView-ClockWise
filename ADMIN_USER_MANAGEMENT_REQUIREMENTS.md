# Admin User Management Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements and implementation details for the Admin User Management feature in the ClockWise web application. This feature provides administrators with comprehensive tools to manage user roles and business unit assignments.

## Access Control

### Admin-Only Access
- **Requirement**: The User Management page must be accessible only to users with ADMIN role
- **Implementation**: 
  - Navigation menu item only appears for users with `user.role === "ADMIN"`
  - Page-level protection displays "Access Denied" message for non-admin users
  - Route protection ensures unauthorized users cannot access `/admin/users`

### Navigation Integration
- **Menu Item**: "User Management" with Settings icon
- **Route**: `/admin/users`
- **Visibility**: Only visible to admin users in both desktop and mobile navigation

## Core Functionality

### User Listing and Search
- **Display All Users**: Show comprehensive list of all users in the system
- **Search Capability**: Search by name, username, or email
- **Filtering Options**:
  - Role filter (ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE)
  - Business Unit filter (including "Unassigned")
  - Status filter (ACTIVE, INACTIVE, PENDING)

### User Information Display
For each user, display:
- **Avatar**: Initials-based avatar with special highlighting for current user
- **Basic Info**: Full name, username, email, phone number (if available)
- **Role Badge**: Color-coded role indicator with icon
- **Status Badge**: Color-coded status indicator
- **Business Unit Badge**: Current business unit assignment
- **Current User Indicator**: Special styling and "(You)" label for the logged-in admin

### User Editing Capabilities
- **Inline Editing**: Click edit button to switch to edit mode
- **Editable Fields**:
  - User role (dropdown: ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE)
  - Business unit assignment (dropdown of available units plus "Unassigned")
- **Save/Cancel Actions**: Save button with loading state, cancel button to discard changes
- **Self-Edit Protection**: Admin cannot edit their own user record

## Technical Requirements

### API Integration
- **Fetch Users**: `GET /api/users` - Retrieve all users
- **Fetch Business Units**: `GET /api/business-units` - Retrieve available business units
- **Update User**: `PUT /api/users/{userId}` - Update user role and business unit

### Data Handling
- **Response Format Flexibility**: Handle various API response structures
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Extract business units from user data if dedicated endpoint fails
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

### User Interface
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Show loading indicators during data fetching and updates
- **Success/Error Messages**: Clear feedback for user actions
- **Color-Coded Elements**: 
  - Roles: Purple (Admin), Blue (Manager), Green (Employee)
  - Status: Green (Active), Red (Inactive), Yellow (Pending)
  - Business Units: Blue styling

## Business Logic

### Role Management
- **Available Roles**: ADMIN, MANAGER, EMPLOYEE
- **Role Updates**: Admin can modify any user's role except their own
- **Role Preservation**: When adding users to business units, existing roles must be preserved

### Business Unit Assignment
- **Assignment Options**: Any available business unit or "Unassigned"
- **Multiple Assignments**: Users can be reassigned between business units
- **Data Consistency**: Both `businessUnitId` and `businessUnitName` must be updated together

### Data Integrity
- **Required Fields**: Role is required for all users
- **Validation**: Ensure valid role and business unit selections
- **Consistency**: Maintain data consistency across role and business unit updates

## User Experience

### Search and Filtering
- **Real-time Search**: Instant filtering as user types
- **Combined Filters**: Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- **Clear Results**: Show "No matching users found" when filters return no results

### Editing Workflow
1. User clicks edit button
2. Dropdowns appear with current values selected
3. User makes changes
4. Click save to update or cancel to discard
5. Success message appears on successful update
6. User list refreshes with updated data

### Error Handling
- **Network Errors**: Clear error messages for connection issues
- **Validation Errors**: Inline validation messages
- **Session Expiry**: Redirect to login when session expires
- **Auto-Dismiss**: Error and success messages auto-dismiss after timeout

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- **Role-Based Access**: Only ADMIN users can access the feature
- **Self-Modification Protection**: Admins cannot modify their own role/status
- **Session Validation**: All API calls include authentication headers

### Data Protection
- **Sensitive Information**: Email and phone displayed securely
- **Audit Trail**: User modifications should be logged (backend requirement)
- **Input Validation**: Validate all user inputs before submission

## Testing Scenarios

### Access Control Testing
- [ ] Non-admin users cannot see navigation menu item
- [ ] Non-admin users get access denied message when accessing URL directly
- [ ] Admin users can access page normally

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] User list loads correctly with all information
- [ ] Search filters users correctly by name, username, email
- [ ] Role filter works for all role types
- [ ] Business unit filter works for all units including "Unassigned"
- [ ] Status filter works for all status types
- [ ] Multiple filters can be combined

### Editing Testing
- [ ] Edit button switches to edit mode
- [ ] Role dropdown shows all available roles with current selection
- [ ] Business unit dropdown shows all units with current selection
- [ ] Save button updates user successfully
- [ ] Cancel button discards changes
- [ ] Current user cannot edit themselves
- [ ] Success message appears after successful update
- [ ] Error message appears for failed updates

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile and desktop
- [ ] Loading states display correctly
- [ ] Color coding is consistent and accessible
- [ ] Messages auto-dismiss after appropriate time
- [ ] Navigation integration works properly

## Performance Considerations

### Data Loading
- **Efficient Fetching**: Load all users once, filter client-side
- **Business Unit Caching**: Cache business unit list
- **Lazy Loading**: Consider pagination for large user lists (future enhancement)

### State Management
- **Local State**: Use React state for UI interactions
- **Data Refresh**: Refresh user list after modifications
- **Filter Performance**: Client-side filtering for responsive experience

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features
- **Bulk Operations**: Select multiple users for bulk role/unit changes
- **User Creation**: Add new users directly from admin panel
- **Advanced Filtering**: Date-based filters, more granular search options
- **Export Functionality**: Export user list to CSV/Excel

### Audit and Monitoring
- **Change History**: Track all user modifications
- **Admin Activity Log**: Log all admin actions
- **Notifications**: Email notifications for role changes

### Integration Enhancements
- **Keycloak Integration**: Direct integration with Keycloak for user management
- **LDAP Sync**: Synchronize with external user directories
- **API Improvements**: Enhanced APIs for better data handling

## Implementation Status
