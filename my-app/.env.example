# ClockWise App Environment Configuration

# Development URLs (localhost) are automatically used when running `npm run dev`
# For production deployment, update the API configuration in src/config/api.js

# When deploying to production, replace the PROD URLs in src/config/api.js with your actual production URLs:
# Example:
# MAIN_API.PROD = "https://api.clockwise.com/v1"
# AUTH_API.PROD = "https://auth.clockwise.com/v1"

# Note: This app automatically detects development vs production environment
# In development: uses localhost URLs
# In production: uses the URLs specified in src/config/api.js
